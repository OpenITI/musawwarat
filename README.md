# musawwarat: Page Images organized following OpenITI CTS scheme

Photocopies of texts (most coming from Waqfeya.com/Archive.org).

URL Prefix  ("cts namespace"): <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenITI/musawwarat/master/>

Naming scheme follows OpenITI CTS-scheme, although the version/edition part is constructed differently:

- `11222233344` : 12 [!] characters
	- 11: first to consonants of the place, e.g.:
		- `BY` for Bayrūt;
		- `QH` for al-Qāhiraŧ/Cairo, etc.;
		- `NN` for `no place`;
	- `2222`: numbers for the year of publication in `CE`;
		- `NNNN` for `no date`;
		- provide the year of the 1st volume for multivolume editions where volumes have been published over a period of time.
	- `333`: abbreviated name of the editor (no particular principle, just keep the list of who is abbreviated how):
		- `BCM`: Baššār ʿAwwād Maʿrūf;
		- `TAD`: ʿUmar ʿAbd al-Salām Tadmurī;
		- `MQC`: Muḥammad ʿAbd al-Qādir ʿAṭā;
		- etc.;
		- `NNN` for `no editor`
	- `44` for the edition number:
			- `01` for 1st edition;
			- `02` for 2nd edition;
			- `NN` for `no data`, although `01` can be assigned in case no specific info is given.
